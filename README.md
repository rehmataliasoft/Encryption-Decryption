# Encryption-Decryption
This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt files using a password in .NET 7. The application allows users to securely encrypt files and then decrypt them using the same password. It employs the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm along with a salt and a password-based key derivation function to enhance security.
